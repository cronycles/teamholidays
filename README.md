## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `restore`

Is the first command to install all needed librer√≠as that are mandatory to run up the application

### `npm run run:server`
This starts the json server db, a quick db that hosts the data. You need to run this command before the `npm run:local`

### `npm run run:local`
Starts the app in development mode.\
Opens [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) on your browser.

### `npm run run:local-ssllegacy`
like the previous but this works if you have a node version greater than 17

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm build-ssllegacy`
like the previous but this works if you have a node version greater than 17

### `npm run run:production`

It starts the application with node, using the library **serve** that, with the previous **restore** command it has been installed globally

## How it works
You have a folder `src/configuration` in witch you have to set the main configuration every year. 
You simply have to copy and paste configuration under a folder named with you current year.
Than you can change the parameters inside the files and than launch your application.

NOTE: if you do not have the current year configuration it will get the past year one, 
otherwise the application throws errors.

## First start
To run for first time the application, before you need to install all the libraries and then launch server first and then run the application. these are the following npm command you need to run:
* `npm run restore`
* `npm run run:server`
* `npm run run:local`

## Debug (VScode)

To debug it you need to:

- run server
- run local
- and then press F5 or the green arrow in VS Code to launch the debugger and open a new browser instance
